Compartment model for prescription opiate addiction for our mathematical modelling class (APM348) at UofT.

Most of the files in this repo are us just messing around/testing how the model behaves. The bulk of the model is in opiate_functions.py which defines the system of differential equations as well as a couple of cost functions. It also has some example parameters and initial conditions written out referenced from a paper.
